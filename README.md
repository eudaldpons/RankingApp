# Ranking App 

Welcome to the Ranking App README! This Flutter app allows users to create and view rankings of various items. Below you'll find information about the app.

### How to run the app (ran it on iPhone 14 Pro Max Simulator):

 1. Add `OpenAI_API_KEY`in /lib/data/service/api_service.dart file
 2. flutter run

### Development Time:
I spent approximately 30 minutes brainstorming ideas and creating a prototype in Figma. For the programming part, I dedicated around 9 hours and 30 minutes.

### Added Features:
History in Local Storage: Implemented a feature to store the history of rankings locally on the user's device. This allows users to access their previously created rankings even when offline.

Enriched Ranking Answer: Enhanced the ranking answers by including links and images alongside the text. This provides users with more detailed information about each ranked item.

Markdown Text Support: Implemented Markdown text support for ranking descriptions and additional details. Users can format their ranking entries using Markdown syntax for better readability.

Animations on Load: Added animations to the app's loading screen to provide users with a visually pleasing experience while waiting for content to load.
